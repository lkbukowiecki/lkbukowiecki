- 👋 Hi, I’m @lkbukowiecki
Long story short before pandemic I messed around with Brain Computer Interfaces.
This was my first "professional" programming experience.
- 👀 I’m interested in being human.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Kivy, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I'm pretty open, but probably those BCIs I've mentioned.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail.
